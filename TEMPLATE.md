### Hello There! ðŸ‘‹

##### Welcome to my Profile

My name is anonisnap and I'm a fan of most things Software, and I love to optimize different things whenever I find the possibility to do so

Though, a little problematic, I often try to do things without help first, and only look for other options when I'm completely stuck, or have a working solution

<hr>

Some of my favourite things include:
- Playing Videogames
- Making small QOL scripts
- Horrible and Naive bots for games
- Watching Anime
- Reading Manga

My current experience with Programming Languages include:
- Java
- C# / .NET
- Python
- C
- AHK

In the future I would like to learn the basics of more different languages, and expand my own horizon

Some of the other languages I've had a brief look at include:
- Kotlin
- JavaScript
- C++
